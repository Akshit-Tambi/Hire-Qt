    "description": "**Bengali \\_ AI Data Trainer \\- Fully Remote**\n\n\n\nThe Business Context\n\n\n\nYou already use AI in many ways—like deciding what products and services to order—and it may be most familiar to you as a chatbot, as an avatar\\-maker, or as a way to unlock your screen. But here's what AI may be able to help the world with: finding medical diagnoses, teaching you about scientific research, and calculating the complexities of any function.\n\n\n\nBut, like humans, algorithms are what they eat. They're only as good as the rules they know and the data they're trained on. We're the team that helps model these behaviors.\n\n\n\nThe Role\n\n\n\nAs an Advanced AI Data Trainer you will be working closely with a team of other trainers, within protocols developed by the world's leading AI researchers— training the AI to read, write, summarize knowledge, and interpret meaning. Think of it like being a language arts teacher or a personal tutor for some of the world's most influential technology.\n\n\n\nThe goal of this AI is to be a safe, accurate, widely knowledgeable, and beneficial conversation partner to the world for a wide variety of purposes. Your job is to train, evaluate, and test the AI's conversation skills, continuously equipping it to fulfill that purpose.\n\n\n\nDay in and day out, you will:\n\n\n**Train the AI**\n\n\n\nYou'll spend the bulk of your time generating examples of ideal conversations, acting as both the User and the AI for the AI to learn from, collecting sources helping it read large swaths of humanity's documented knowledge and distinguish between what is presented as fact vs. context vs. patterns of behavior.\n\n\n**Evaluate the AI**\n\n\n\nOur partner's mission is to develop AI models that are safe, accurate, and beneficial to humanity. You will continuously evaluate the AI according to those criteria and our training methods. For example, you will be discerning the accuracy of the facts that the AI is outputting, but also the accuracy with which they *interpret them.*\n\n\n**Test the AI**\n\n\n\nHow is testing different from evaluation? As the project grows over time, you'll spend time actively trying to \"break\" the AI by \"forcing\" mistakes and improving the way these AI models recover. This is absolutely critical to its safety, accuracy, and use. You'll document breaks and have the opportunity to recommend improvements to the training methods themselves to both our team and our client.\n\n\n\nThe Person\n\n\n\nThis is a technology job that accommodates humanities people and relies more fully on your *competencies* than your formal experience––making it a rare opportunity that's perfect for new grads, career transitioners, and those seeking an exciting encore career.\n\n\n\nYou're the sort of person who is exceptional at generating copy intuitively. You've also got the metacognitive awareness to \"show your work.\" In addition, you're the sort of person with a deep interest in linguistics. If you didn't get a Ph.D., you probably wanted one. You instinctively document learnings and continuously refine methods.\n\n\n\nYou are a(n):\n\n\n* Dedicated Grammarian\n* Natural Writer\n* Diligent Reader\n* Observant Listener\n* Self\\-Aware Interpreter\n* Synthetic Sense\\-Maker\n* Perpetual Learner\n* Instinctive Educator\n* **Fluent in Bengali\\***\n\n\n**Compensation \\& Career**\n\n\n**Compensation**\n\n\n\nThis is an entry\\-level *role* perfect for voracious readers early in their careers, or for career switchers keen to enter the technology field. Pay begins between **$6\\.00\\-$10\\.00 / hour** to top applicants worldwide.  \n\n  \n\n**Must be fluent in Bengali(C1 \\- C2\\)**  \n\n**MInimum: Conversational \\- Advanced English (B1 \\- C1\\)**  \n\n**P:S. We work in English however the AI Training will be done in Bengali so its important that you are at least conversational in English for our internal meetings**"
